# Advent of Code - 2019 (TypeScript)

My solution to the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run Puzzle
To run a puzzle use

```sh
npm start DD.PP
```

where DD stands for the day and PP for the part of the puzzle. So Day4 Part 1 would be started like

```sh
npm start 04.01
```

## Run Tests

```
npm test
```
